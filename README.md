# InternConn

As the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the economy and University research programs, thousands of college students, including us, lost amazing opportunities.

We want to help out our fellow students by creating this platform InternConn https://www.internconn.com/ to connect impacted students with ongoing, remote research or internship opportunities.
